## What is “privilege escalation” and why is it important?
Privilege escalation is the process of going from a lower level of access on a system to a higher level of access. Typically, from a normal user account to a root or administrator account.

In the context of penetration testing and exploitation, privilege escalation occurs after gaining initial access to a system and is used to gain full control over the machine. This allows attackers to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted, such as:

- Bypassing access controls to compromise protected data
- Executing administrative or system-level commands
- Creating persistence by adding back doors or scheduled tasks
- Disabling security tools like firewalls or antivirus

…and many more harmful actions. Privilege escalation is an essential part of post-exploitation, and understanding common vectors is crucial to both offensive and defensive security.
